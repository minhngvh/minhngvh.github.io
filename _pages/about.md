My name is Minh Nguyen (Minh Van Hoang Nguyen) and I am currently a senior studying Mathematics at Michigan State University, where I work with Professor Jun Kitagawa on optimal transport and gradient flows. In the fall of 2025, I will be a PhD student in Applied and Computational Mathematics working with Professor Franca Hoffmann.
