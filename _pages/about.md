My name is Minh Nguyen (Minh Van Hoang Nguyen) and I am currently a senior studying Mathematics at Michigan State University, where I work with Professor [Jun Kitagawa](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/jun/) on optimal transport and gradient flows. 

In the fall of 2025, I will be a PhD student in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Caltech working with Professor [Franca Hoffmann](https://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/franca-hoffmann).

### Research Interests: 
- Partial Differential Equations
- Optimal Transport and Differential Geometry
- Machine Learning and Computational Mathematics
