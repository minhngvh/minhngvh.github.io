My name is Minh Nguyen (Minh Van-Hoang Nguyen) and I am currently a first-year PhD student at Caltech in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Caltech working with Professor [Franca Hoffmann](https://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/franca-hoffmann).

Previously, I studied Mathematics at Michigan State University, where I work with Professor [Jun Kitagawa](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/jun/) on optimal transport and gradient flows. 

### Research Interests: 
- Applied Analysis
- Optimal Transport and Partial Differential Equations
- Machine Learning and Computational Mathematics

### News: 
- 11/6/25: New preprint is now on arXiv: check it out: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04579. Joint work with Ricardo Baptista, Franca Hoffmann and Ben Zhang. This is my first math paper!
- 7/20/25: My co-first author paper has been accepted into the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11199960. Joint work with SLIM Group at MSU.
