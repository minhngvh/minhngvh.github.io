My name is Minh Nguyen (Minh Van-Hoang Nguyen) and I am currently a first-year PhD student at Caltech in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Caltech working with Professor [Franca Hoffmann](https://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/franca-hoffmann).

Previously, I studied Mathematics at Michigan State University, where I work with Professor [Jun Kitagawa](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/jun/) on optimal transport and gradient flows. 

### Research Interests: 
- Applied Analysis
- Optimal Transport and Partial Differential Equations
- Machine Learning and Computational Mathematics

### News: 
- 11/6/25: New preprint is now on arXiv. Check it out: [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04579). Joint work with [Ricardo Baptista](https://ricardobaptista.com), [Franca Hoffmann](https://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/franca-hoffmann) and [Ben Zhang](https://benjzhang.com). This is my first math paper!
- 7/20/25: My co-first author paper has been accepted into the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing: [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11199960). Joint work with [SLIM Group](https://slim-msu.github.io/news) at MSU.

### Personal Interests: 
Outside of mathematics, I do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu  and support Manchester United!
